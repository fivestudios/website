					<h2><span class="primary-text">Design</span> Approach</h2>

					<h4>The website design process is both an art and a science. As a business, to provide consistency and a high overall standard of quality we follow a proven design framework based on the best practices of modern website design.</h4>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 typography">
						<h2>Typography</h2>
						<h4>The primary goal of typography is to convey information to website users in the form of arranged letters, words or text. Readability, font types and sizes, positioning and amount of text among other aspects are things that one has to take into consideration when thinking of a website userâ€™s experience when they view a website.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 colours">
						<h2>Colours</h2>
						<h4>Colours have a direct effect on the mood, perception, feelings, and interaction of a website user. We understand that choosing, combining, and using the right colors for a specific website product is crucial to your company. It creates an impact and assists in achieving your website goal, whether you wish to acquire potential clients, close a sale or reach marketing goals.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 spacing">
						<h2>Spacing</h2>
						<h4>Spacing involves the positioning of website elements within a page. More specifically, we look at the distances between text, images and other elements for a more esthetically pleasing page. Elements that are close together comprise a block pertaining to a single general idea. The proper spacing between website elements provides a logical means of imparting information.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 consistency">
						<h2>Consistency</h2>
						<h4>Consistency requires a web design to provide the user with a familiar feeling. Users want a hassle-free experience when using a website, they want something familiar so that they are able to adapt quickly to the website and your product. Internal consistency on the other hand requires all pages in a website to have a consistent visual appeal and consistent functional experience, thereby promoting ease of use and zero confusion.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 imagery">
						<h2>Imagery</h2>
						<h4>In our digital world, it is evident we communicate best through imagery; humans are visual by nature. With this in mind, it is imperative to utilize high quality imagery to promote what your company does, as well as, what you sell for it to be compelling for the viewer. We have a keen eye for finding just the image you need to engage your consumer.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 mobile-compatibility">
						<h2>Mobile Compatibility</h2>
						<h4>On a global scale, there has been a rising trend of mobile internet use. This rising trend has exceeded the number of desktop internet users. Being able to cater to both markets would give your website a distinct advantage. FIVE Studios provides websites that are compatible with both desktop and mobile devices without the need for separate mobile versions.</h4>

									<h4>Sitemap</h4>
									<p>We will work with you to structure the content architecture of the site which is commonly referred to as the sitemap. Firstly, we will identify who the major visitor types are and make sure that all content is intuitively available for all visitor user types. In addition, we will also dive into your current Analytics data to see how current visitors are interacting with your content.</p>

									<h4>Content</h4>
									<p>As developers, we are here to create your website. However, we are not responsible for the information on the site. So, we ask you to work with us collaboratively and provide us with the textual content. If writing the content poses a problem, we would be more than happy to refer you to highly trusted writers who are able to help with your needs.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">

									<h4>Imagery</h4>
									<p>There are a few options when it comes to imagery. If you have existing images for us to work with, we are happy to use them. However, if need be, we can also help source and curate imagery based on your approval. If stock imagery is used, we can purchase the images on your behalf and add the cost to your final invoice.</p>

									<h4>Home Page</h4>
									<p>The first step to the design of a new website is locking in the design for the homepage. The Free Mockup Offer is a mockup of the homepage of the website. Once we start working together we will have plenty of opportunities to go back and forth with revisions to realize your dream home page. Once you have signed off on the homepage design we will then move forward with the mockups for the inner pages.</p>

									<i class="fa fa-question-circle-o"></i><br>
									<h4>Inner Pages</h4>
									<p>Once the homepage mockup is ready to go a mockup of all the unique inner page templates will be made. The page templates are all created together and revisions for these pages are all done together in batches. Once we have gone back and forth with revisions for the inner page templates, the design process will have been completed and we're ready to start the development of the site.</p>

									<h4>Website Development</h4>
									<p>We will develop your site on a live test server. The site will be developed to be fully mobile responsive.

									<h4>SEO & QA Testing</h4>
									<p>We will identify the keywords you need to be ranking for, tag, and structure your site, this will help optimize you site so it ranks when keywords are used. We will test your site across all major devices and browsers to make sure that everything is functioning and displaying properly and looks just like the design we agreed upon.</p>
