									<h4>1. Discovery Meeting</h4>
									<span>At FIVE Studios we want to get to know your company; your mission, your vision, your goals for your brand. The first step to achieving this is during our discovery meeting. Our team will create a custom strategy and create a coherent plan for a great website for your use, as well as, your future users.</span>

							<div class="slides slide1">

									<h4>2. Website Proposal</h4>

									<h4>3. Mockup Review</h4>
									<span>If you like the mockup and want to move forward we will do so with the terms outlined in our proposal. If not, there are no hard feelings and no other obligations. We're glad to have built a relationship with you and hopefully we can be a right fit for your future endeavors!</span>

									<h4>4. Sitemap</h4>
									<span>We will work with you to structure the content architecture of the site which is commonly referred to as the sitemap. Firstly, we will identify who the major visitor types are and make sure that all content is intuitively available for all visitor user types. In addition, we will also dive into your current Analytics data to see how current visitors are interacting with your content.</span>

									<h4>5. Content</h4>
									<span>As developers, we are here to create your website. However, we are not responsible for the information on the site. So, we ask you to work with us collaboratively and provide us with the textual content. If writing the content poses a problem, we would be more than happy to refer you to highly trusted writers who are able to help with your needs.</span>
								</div>

							<div class="slides2 slide2">
								<div class="slide-content2">
									<h4>6. Imagery</h4>
									<span>There are a few options when it comes to imagery. If you have existing images for us to work with, we are happy to use them. However, if need be, we can also help source and curate imagery based on your approval. If stock imagery is used, we can purchase the images on your behalf and add the cost to your final invoice.</span>

									<h4>7. Home Page</h4>
									<span>The first step to the design of a new website is locking in the design for the homepage. The Free Mockup Offer is a mockup of the homepage of the website. Once we start working together we will have plenty of opportunities to go back and forth with revisions to realize your dream home page. Once you have signed off on the homepage design we will then move forward with the mockups for the inner pages.</span>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="slides3 slide3">
								<div class="slide-content3">
									<h4>8. Inner Pages</h4>
									<span>Once the homepage mockup is ready to go a mockup of all the unique inner page templates will be made. The page templates are all created together and revisions for these pages are all done together in batches. Once we have gone back and forth with revisions for the inner page templates, the design process will have been completed and we're ready to start the development of the site.</span>

									<h4>9. Website Development</h4>
									<span>We will develop your site on a live test server. The site will be developed to be fully mobile responsive. We will make sure that your website displays properly across the latest versions of all major web browsers. Once the site is developed, we will populate the new site with all of its content and imagery.</span>

									<h4>10. SEO & QA Testing</h4>
									<span>We will identify the keywords you need to be ranking for, tag, and structure your site, this will help optimize you site so it ranks when keywords are used. We will test your site across all major devices and browsers to make sure that everything is functioning and displaying properly and looks just like the design we agreed upon.</span>

We will provide you with detailed tutorial on how to update and edit all aspects of the site without having to know how to code.</span>
